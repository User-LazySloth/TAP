I am making a portal for teaching assistants where students can sign in with their SRN. when they login, they can apply for a teaching assistant position with a teacher and subject of their choice. the teacher will have a dashboard where they can see the students' requests and approve them. In case they are approved, the student can see the TA dashboard where they can see and update their worklog and bank account details. I need a good looking, stylish frontend with these features and functionalities across multiple pages. Please make it look good and functional. You can try integrating it with the Flask backend given below:
